# cplug.org Mirror
cplug.org, rewritten to utilize a Django backend for officers, events, and
more!

## Warning: do not push to this repo
This repo is a mirror of the repository currently on the Raspberry Pi of 
@steelcowboy, which is where cplug.org is currently hosted. Any pushes here 
will be overwritten and could likely cause issues leading to the need for a 
`git push --force`, and no one wants that, right?

# TODO
- Set up blog
    - Figure out Markdown system -- can Django do this?
- Set up help section
- Set up officers portal
    - Officers authentication
- History app
